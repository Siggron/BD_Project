Database Systems

This project was developed as part of the Database Systems course and involved implementing a Database System for a fictional case of a second-hand video game store.

In an initial phase, we defined the system, gathered requirements, and performed conceptual and logical modeling. We then proceeded to the physical implementation, where we constructed the actual database with the necessary tables and populated them (using both SQL and Python). We created SQL scripts with queries and procedures, indexes, views, and so on. Additionally, we developed a batch file capable of performing a backup of the database.
